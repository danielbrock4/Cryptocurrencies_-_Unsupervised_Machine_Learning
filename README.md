# Cryptocurrencies & Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Resources

- **Data Source:** 
  - [crypto_data.csv](crypto_data.csv/crypto_data.csv)
- **Software:** Python, Pandas, Hvplot, Plotly, Sklearn

## Challenge Project Overview 


Using Sklearn, Python, & Plotly, I analyzed a dataset of cryptocurrencies with unsupervised machine learning algorithms to spot any trends that would make a client want to invest in them. Since Ethereum and Bitcoin have already exploded in value, there is great interest in finding the next big project among all the alternative coins. That said, I will be using unsupervised machine learning to see if we can spot any trends resulting in altcoin opportunities.

## Challange Project Summary

#### Three Recommendations for Addressing Disparities Among City Type

1) Decrease Fares in Rural and Suburban Areas To Encourage More Riders 
2) Shift Drivers from Urban Areas to Suburban Areas to Capture The 2nd Biggest Market 
3) Decrease Drivers in Urban Areas to Increase Market Demand to Drive Up Fares
